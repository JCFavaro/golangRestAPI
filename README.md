## Description 🚀

Simple Rest API with CRUD operations to handle tasks.

**We can**

* Create a task
* View all tasks or just the one we want
* Update a task
* Delete a task

## Built with 🛠️

* [Golang](https://golang.org/) for the backend 
* [gorilla/mux](https://github.com/gorilla/mux) to implement a request router
* [GO CORS handler](https://github.com/rs/cors) was used for enable CORS
* Vanilla JavaScript using [API Fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch) to fetch the API
* Frontend with [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
